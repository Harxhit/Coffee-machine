## Key Features:
Menu Selection: Users can choose from a variety of coffee options.
Resource Management: Tracks the levels of ingredients and alerts when resources are low.
Transaction Handling: Accepts payments and returns change if necessary.
Maintenance Functions: Includes options to refill resources and retrieve earnings.
Technologies Used: Python, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), functions, loops.
Outcome: Improved understanding of Python programming concepts and gained experience in simulating real-world applications.
